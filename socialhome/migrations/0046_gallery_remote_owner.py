"""Drop the local-user FKs on ``gallery_albums`` / ``gallery_items`` (#650).

Cross-household gallery **metadata** never synced. A synced album or item is
owned by a user on another household, who by definition has no local ``users``
row, so these constraints made the INSERT impossible:

    gallery_albums.owner_user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    gallery_items.uploaded_by    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id) ...

The §25.6 receiver swallowed the resulting IntegrityError as "already exists",
so a member household ended up with the image *bytes* on disk (those ride a
durable retry outbox) and no rows at all. Directly-paired members were affected
too, not just mesh-joined ones.

Federated content elsewhere already models this correctly:
``space_posts.author`` is a bare ``TEXT NOT NULL`` with no FK, commented
"user_id or 'system-integration'", precisely because the author may be remote.
This brings gallery in line.

Why dropping the constraint is safe rather than merely convenient: the
``ON DELETE CASCADE`` it carries is **unreachable today**. Nothing in the
codebase hard-deletes a ``users`` row — ``UserService.deprovision`` only
soft-deletes (``state='inactive'`` plus ``deleted_at`` / ``grace_until``), and
no purge job consumes ``grace_until``. So no cascade can currently fire, and
removing it changes no local behaviour. Nothing JOINs either column either;
both are read straight back out as provenance and rendered.

Written as a Python migration rather than SQL because SQLite can only drop a
constraint by rebuilding the table, and that is genuinely dangerous here:
with ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` (which ``AsyncDatabase`` sets *before* running
migrations), ``DROP TABLE gallery_albums`` performs an implicit delete of every
row, which cascades into ``gallery_items`` and would destroy the user's entire
gallery. ``PRAGMA foreign_keys`` is also a silent no-op inside a transaction.
So this migration asserts the pragma actually took effect, and verifies the
row counts survive, aborting before any destructive step if either check fails.
