"""Migration 0046 — drop the local-user FKs on the gallery tables (#650).

The rebuild is the dangerous kind: with foreign-key enforcement on,
``DROP TABLE gallery_albums`` implicitly deletes every row and cascades
into ``gallery_items``, which would destroy the user's whole gallery. These
tests pin both that it preserves data and that it refuses to run when the
pragma it depends on hasn't taken effect.
